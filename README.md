# Fancy-Coupons
We all have had this problem before, you want to gift a coupon to someone but don't want to simply write it down on a piece of paper or a post-it.
A fancy coupon, which could be printed out as a photo would save the day! This is the repo & solution for you. Simply edit the html files to you likings and print out a screenshot. You can share these fancy coupons with friends ðŸ‘« & family.
